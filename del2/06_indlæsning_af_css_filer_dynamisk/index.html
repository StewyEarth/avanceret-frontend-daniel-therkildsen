        <p>The vine.co website became the Vine Archive in January 2017 â€“ a time capsule of Vines that were created through the Vine app so you can continue to browse them and share them on other websites. In April of 2018, we moved the Vine Archive into a more static archived state to allow us to better preserve the public, creative expression of the Vine community. This new version of the Vine Archive  allows you to watch Vines on vine.co (or anywhere that URL might be embedded) and share Vines via their unique URLs.</p>
